// This creates a new layer that is rendered directly on the GPU and has own RAM footprint.
// That way this can be animated/transitioned without any performance hit.
// This will sometimes fix rendering bugs where different layers overlap/break
//
// Keep in mind that you shouldn't overuse this as it allocates this layer into the VRAM.
// If you have a lot of layers, you can just fill the maximum of VRAM.
